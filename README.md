# Hyperspectral-CNN-LSTM
Project for Deep Learning for Real-Time Hyperspectral Image Classification Using CNN-LSTM model

We made a model to perform classifications on Hyperspectral Images from the Indian Pines Dataset from Purdue University. The model is an ensemble model of a CNN and a Long Short-Term Memory RNN.
